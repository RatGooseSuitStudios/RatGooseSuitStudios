One week of development time has passed. Let's go over what we've done so far!

## Code

#### NPC AI

We have begun work on a simple agent AI, which will allow the security agents to follow regular routines and chase the player once spotted.

#### Game Systems

Work has started on the main menu and settings menu, as well as systems which will allow us to pause the game and load savestates.
