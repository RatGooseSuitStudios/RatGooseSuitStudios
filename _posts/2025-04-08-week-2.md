We are now in week two of development on <i>Travelling with Taste</i>. Let's go over what's new!

## General

### UI

We've gotten some major progress on in-game UI!

We've created a functional main menu (set in a temporary scene).

Clicking on the "Credits" button will take you a screen with scrolling credits for our game.

We've created a sample UI button which we will implement in the coming days.

We've outlined basic in-game UI, which features a timer and a cheese counter. The cheese counter is functional, and it will increase when the player collides with a collectible cheese object, and decrease when the player throws cheese.


## Art

Let's take a look at our Art Progress this week!

### Models

First, we've finished our model for the Airport Security NPC.

These are front and back pictures of our model.

Here is a sculpt of the Airport Security Agent without any textures.

Next, we modeled a conveyer belt asset and a sample button. Both of these were created, textured, and imported into the game.

Finally, we've made an updated version of our player character, the suitcase.

### Animations

We've created a button press animation as well

We're also created a scolling mask for the conveyor belt to indicate direction. 

## Tech

### Player Mechanics

We implemented basic functionality for all of the player's movement and game actions. This includes moving forward, moving backward, rotating left, rotating right, sprinting (with an FOV zoom-out!), and extending/retracting a "handle" object.

### Enemy Mechanics

We created an AI behavior tree and patrol system allowing enemies to walk between patrol nodes in the world. We are currently implementing a system to distract enemies when they see a cheese object.

### World Mechanics

Finally, we implemented functionality for conveyor belts in the game world. They use a panning mask to animate a scrolling texture and properly move overlapping actors in the intended direction.
