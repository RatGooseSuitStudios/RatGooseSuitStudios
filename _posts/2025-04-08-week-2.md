We are now in week two of development on <i>Travelling with Taste</i>. Let's go over what's new!

## General

## Art

### Models

### Textures

### Animations

## Tech

### Player Mechanics

We implemented basic functionality for all of the player's movement and game actions. This includes moving forward, moving backward, rotating left, rotating right, sprinting (with an fov zoom-out!), and extending/retracting a "handle" object.

### Enemy Mechanics

We created an AI behavior tree and patrol system allowing enemies to walk between patrol nodes in the world. We are currently implementing a system to distract enemies when they see a cheese object.

### World Mechanics

Finally, we implemented functionality for conveyor belts in the game world. They use a panning mask to animate a scrolling texture and properly move overlapping actors in the intended direction.
