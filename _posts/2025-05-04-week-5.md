Now that we've finished the final full week of production, there is light at the end of the tunnel!

## General

We've submitted Traveling With Taste to PAX East!

In addition, we've made a ton of progress and changes over the past week as we worked towards this milestone. See below for more.

### Audio


## Art


### New Level Layout

We redesigned the level to better convey the mechanics and encourage more clever play overall.

</p>

### New Title Screen, Win Screen, & Lose Screen

The title screen, win screen, and lose screen have all been reworked to add extra flair and to make the game even sillier. Sound was added to help convey the game's story as well.

### Re-textured Suitcase

The suitcase model was revamped, allowing it to open in animations, like when cheese is thrown. It was also re-textured.

### Redesigned Whiteboard Tutorials

The whiteboards were also redone, so they more clearly convey the controls and are easier to see.

### More Assets

New clutter assets have been created, like chairs, tables, pipes, cardboard boxes, and a vat of cheese.
