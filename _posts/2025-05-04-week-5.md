Now that we've finished the final full week of production, there is light at the end of the tunnel!

## General

We've submitted Traveling With Taste to PAX East!

In addition, we've made a ton of progress and changes over the past week as we worked towards this milestone. See below for more.

## Audio

A lot of audio was added to the game! There is music, most object interactions have sound effects, as well as the player, and enemies have randomized voice lines when seeing the player or finding cheese.

## Art


### New Level Layout

We redesigned the level to better convey the mechanics and encourage more clever play overall.

</p>

### New Title Screen, Win Screen, & Lose Screen

The title screen, win screen, and lose screen have all been reworked to add extra flair and to make the game even sillier. Sound was added to help convey the game's story as well.

### Re-textured Suitcase

The suitcase model was revamped, allowing it to open in animations, like when cheese is thrown. It was also re-textured.

### Redesigned Whiteboard Tutorials

The whiteboards were also redone, so they more clearly convey the controls and are easier to see.

### More Assets

New clutter assets have been created, like chairs, tables, pipes, cardboard boxes, and a vat of cheese.

## Tech

Many various bugs were fixed.

### Player Movement

The player's physics were changed based on playtesting feedback to feel more fun and chaotic, with some aspects such as going through doors or around corners being made more lenient and more easily controllable.

### Enemy AI

#### Detection Indicators

We finalized our enemy vision cone design to use a spot light that indicates the enemy's general vision detection zone. The light will turn from yellow to red as the enemy's detection meter raises.

We also implemented two indicators to help the player see how close they are to being detected.

The first indicator appears above the enemy's head when they begin detecting the player. The white question mark fills with red as their detection meter increases.

The second indicator is a UI widget that also appears when the enemy begins detecting the player. The widget fills from white to red and points in the direction of the enemy in relation to the camera.

</p>

#### Vision Tweaks

We modified the enemy detection system to only start detecting the player if they move or extend their handle within the enemy's vision cone.

#### Sound Emitting
We added the ability for thrown cheese to emit a "hearing event" when hitting the ground. Any nearby enemy will "hear" the cheese and turn to face it, allowing the player to distract enemies without relying on throwing cheese in their vision cone.

### Shaders
We remade our outline shader to affect the inner edges of objects and be easily tweakable. We also changed the outline color to black, giving the visuals a more cartoon-y feel.

By using custom stencil buffers, specific objects like in-world widgets can be excluded from the shader.
