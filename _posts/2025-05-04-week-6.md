We made it! Let's take a look at the final state of our beta.

## General

Our beta is fully complete! Let's take a look!

## UI

We made a few UI changes! 
<ul>
<li>Created an intro sequence: the player rides a conveyor belt into the level. Then the game displays a few sentences describing the context for the game, before launching into the level.</li>
<li>Created an ending sequence: the player listens to an airplane taking off sound, followed by an airplane "chime". Then, all of the cheese they collected crashes into the scene.</li>
<li>Fixed behavior that creates multiple menus as a result of spam-clicking menu buttons.</li>
<li>Fixed pause menu bug.
</ul>

We've adjusted the volume of all of our sound effects and music, ensuring the player can here everything!
