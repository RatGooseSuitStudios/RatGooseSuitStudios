It's week 3, and we've been hard at work preparing to release the alpha build of Travelling with Taste. Let's go over our work this past week!

## General

The alpha version of Travelling with Taste can be downloaded and played! You can find the download by clicking the Releases button at the top right of this page.

### Audio

In terms of audio, we have edited a few rat squeaking sound effects and implemented the button press/unpress sound in a feature branch. We hope to implement more of our existing sound effects in Unreal over the next week.

### UI

UI has been fleshed out further with the addition of a pause menu and win/lose screens.

## Art



### Models

This week we also prepared for our Midterm Art Review, which can be seen [here]({{% 2025-04-14-art-review %}})! In summary, we have created additional assets for light fixtures, a whiteboard conveying the game's controls, metal beams, and animations for the doors. In addition, we have made progress rigging the suitcase and animating the handle.
