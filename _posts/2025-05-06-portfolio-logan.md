# Artistic Game Development II Portfolio

Below is a short list of the things I worked on for Artistic Game Development II (Traveling With Taste)

I tried to work on a lot of different aspects of the project, from animation to level design

## Suitcase Animation Reel

The animations and rig for the suitcase eventually got redone a third time by Jadon, but this is a look at my work on the second pass of the suitcase animations.

	</video>

## Cheese Vat

I haven't gotten to model as often as I'd like, so making an asset like the Cheese Vat was a fun way to get back into it. The modeling, UV unwrapping, and texturing was all done by myself.

## Initial Level Blockout

The initial level blockout was a fun first attempt at designing our level around our proposed mechanics, and it helped pave the way for the current level that is now used in Traveling With Taste.

## Security Agent Rig

I have never attempted rigging a character until taking this class, so this was a fun challenge. I have a lot more to learn, but here is what it looks like in Unreal.
